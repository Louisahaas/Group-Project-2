        <h3>Sp√§tzle with Sauerkraut</h2>
      <p>Fill a large pot with water, add oil, and bring to a boil.
Place flour in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the middle. Add salt, eggs, and water and beat the dough until smooth and bubbly. The dough should have a thick consistency.
Fill a spaetzle press with the dough and squeeze into the boiling water (You may use a colander to push the dough through or a wooden cutting board and scrape dough little by little with a knife into the water).
When the spaetzle float to the top of the pot, drain them. Place half of the spaetzle in a glass baking dish and add a layer of sauerkraut on top. Add another layer of spaetzle and sauerkraut. Cover the pan to keep the dish warm.
In a separate pan melt the butter and add breadcrumbs just long enough to moisten them. Top the spaetzle with the breadcrumbs.
Place in a preheated oven at 200 C for 15 minutes.
This is also delicious reheated the next day with a little bit of butter.</p>

      <p>1.
Bring 2 1/2 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 3 1/2 teaspoons salt.

2.
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, and eggs. Add 2/3 cup water and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Using your hand, mix to form a dough. Divide the dough into quarters.

3.
Place one quarter of the dough on a small, dampened cutting board, flattening to 1/2-inch thick. Dip a paring knife into the boiling water, and cut the dough into 1-by-1/2-inch pieces directly into the boiling water. Repeat process with remaining dough. If the knife begins to stick to the dough, dip it into the boiling water.

4.
As dumplings are cooking, stir water occasionally to prevent sticking. When dumplings rise to the surface, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a colander to drain. Place in a medium and drizzle with remaining tablespoon oil, and toss to coat. Serve immediately.</p>
