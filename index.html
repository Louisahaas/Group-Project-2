        <h3>Spätzle with Sauerkraut</h3>
          <small>
          <p>
            <ol>teaspoon of oil </ol>
            <ol> 5 eggs </ol>
            <ol>butter </ol>
            <ol>breadcrumbs </ol>
            <ol> 400g of sauerkraut </ol>
          </p>
          </small>
      <p>
        <ol> 1. Fill a large pot with water, add oil, and bring to a boil. </ol>
<ol> 2. Place flour in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the middle. Add salt, eggs, and water and beat the dough until smooth and bubbly. The dough should have a thick consistency.</ol>
<ol> 3. Fill a spaetzle press with the dough and squeeze into the boiling water (You may use a colander to push the dough through or a wooden cutting board and scrape dough little by little with a knife into the water).</ol>
<ol> 4. When the spaetzle float to the top of the pot, drain them. Place half of the spaetzle in a glass baking dish and add a layer of sauerkraut on top. Add another layer of spaetzle and sauerkraut. Cover the pan to keep the dish warm.</ol>
<ol> 5. In a separate pan melt the butter and add breadcrumbs just long enough to moisten them. Top the spaetzle with the breadcrumbs. </ol>
<ol> 6. Place in a preheated oven at 200 C for 15 minutes. </ol>
<ol> 7. This is also delicious reheated the next day with a little bit of butter. </ol> </p>

        <h3>Maultaschen with Eggs</h3>
        <p>
<ol> 1. Bring 2 1/2 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 3 1/2 teaspoons salt. </ol>
<ol> 2. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, and eggs. Add 2/3 cup water and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Using your hand, mix to form a dough. Divide the dough into quarters.</ol>
<ol> 3. Place one quarter of the dough on a small, dampened cutting board, flattening to 1/2-inch thick. Dip a paring knife into the boiling water, and cut the dough into 1-by-1/2-inch pieces directly into the boiling water. Repeat process with remaining dough. If the knife begins to stick to the dough, dip it into the boiling water.</ol>
<ol> 4. As dumplings are cooking, stir water occasionally to prevent sticking. When dumplings rise to the surface, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a colander to drain. Place in a medium and drizzle with remaining tablespoon oil, and toss to coat. Serve immediately.</ol>
